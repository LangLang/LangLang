       Introduction to LangLang for Lua
      ==================================

...

Although Lua is not built on formal foundations as is LangLang, interestingly it is one of the few programming languages that
is also designed around the concept of an associative data structure.
In Lua this data structure is called a table and is almost as ubiquitous as is the list data structure in Lisp.
In fact, the authors even state "Tables are for Lua what lists are for Lisp: powerful data-structuring mechanisms." [ref: http://www.lua.org/ddj.html]

Despite the difference in background, LangLang has a suprisingly similar philosophy to Lua. 
For one thing, it has a compact core with a tiny set of powerful operators.
(TODO: Fit this in: However, where the associative data structure is concerned, LangLang goes even further.
Together with querying operators, associative definitions form a turing complete (but stratified*) calculus on which the entire language has been built!)
