I'm thinking of calling the compiler for langlang "chomp", what do you guys think?

Rehno Lindeque You know, usually I really have intricate reasons for a name but this one came to me somewhat subconciously. Never-the-less it has some implications. I was thinking that the funny thing about "langlang" is that it says exactly what it means...

Rehno Lindeque Most likely if I ever create a parser generator (a.k.a a compiler-compiler) for the language, I'd call it chompchomp

Alex Trujillo personally, I would go with nomnomnom. :)

Alex Trujillo though, you could always use 'nom' as a metasyntactic variable in your docs. in fact, all docs should be in lolcat-speak. >:3

Rehno Lindeque Hahaha, yes, I must use "nomnomnom" for something, that's brilliant! I seem to have convinced myself of "chomp" for the compiler but there will still be opportunity for lots more libraries & tools. By the way, don't know if you've seen it but there's already a programming language for lolcat-speak: http://lolcode.com/

Lindsay Kay Hey is that a generative grammar? nom => nomnom

Alex Trujillo heh, I forgot about that! so appropriate for its time.

Rehno Lindeque Maybe nomnom could also be a virtual machine if I ever decide to split one off from the compiler. First you run chomp and then nomnom takes over :P I got the project for chomp together last night, today I'm starting with the first few lines of code! Yay! The compiler is being written in Haskell and it's also one of my influences so perhaps the "h" in c(h)omp can be a way of paying homage to it.
