                        Community and Organization
                        --------------------------

  "When I started designing LangLang I was following a purely technical imperative,
  'let's design a better tool'. However, as time went by I realized that if it
  should happen that I'm successful in popularizing the language and incubating 
  a community this could involve a large number of people. It is increasingly
  apparent that whenever any institution holds a great portion of a population's
  mind-share, it has an ethical responsibility towards those people - and more than
  that, perhaps even the potential to do great good in the world. However, this 
  requires sound principles, a commitment to serving the citizenship rather than
  ruling over them and resilience to non-civil forces. I have no idea whether it
  is at all plausible that LangLang could influence the world to this degree, but
  it would be a crime not to try now that the thought has been entertained."

Our plan: Provide incentives for the community to self-organize. The interests of
          LangLang as an organization should be designed to align with that of the
          community.
