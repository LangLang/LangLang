  LangLang Ideology
  -----------------

IDEOLOGY
========

In order to make decisions about the language features we need value heuristics for ideas that are not
reducible to formal arguments.

* Types of ideology
  * The human view - "what is best ethically"
  * The technical view - "what is best technically"

Purpose
-------

* The LangLang ideology is necessarily incomplete and should not be taken as the "final" word on "value" principles.
* We would like argue ideology in as rational a manner as possible, using logical and statistical principles where plausible.
* Some ideological principles stack on top of other principles in a hierarchical manner while others provide a tension between them.
  First we take note that often this tension can be lessened not through compromise but by realizing that they are two sides of 
  the same coin and there may be a way of letting them compliment each other instead through innovation.
  Hence we attempt to view conflicting issues from a different view-point rather than simply resorting to compromise immediately.
  That said, if tension truly cannot be resolved then a suitable compromise must be found.

ETHICAL (META-)IDEOLOGY
=======================

* Ideology is subjective and must be balanced around the opinion of its members
  * It is possible (though not necessarily desireable) for groups to split off from the LangLang community due to ideological differences
  * Ideology is not enforced on others - it is given as a guide to be used where it is deemed usefull (such as in making policy decisions)
* Protect the freedom and rights of intelligent beings
* Promote what you believe to be best in context / not only what serves your own interests best
  * Also, respect other's rights to pursue what is in their own interest (but not necessarily letting it enroach on your own or others' rights)
* Take responsibility for your beliefs
  * Acknowledge counter-arguments 
     * When they are valid or invalid, by affirmation or countering respectively
  * Adequetely prepare your arguments, by backing it up with research and evidence or else acknowledge the lack thereof
  * Avoid logical traps such as circular reasoning
  * Avoid pointless bickering - an argument should have an expected outcome which benefits all parties involved. If it is apparent that
    there is no benefit to continueing then terminate the discussion respectfully and put your energy to better use.
* Provide value to the community
  * In terms of language design our focus is on specifically enriching the value of the language for the LangLang community as a whole.
  * What constitutes the "LangLang community" may not be clear, but might be approximated by the concept of "vested interest" (accumulated)

PRACTICALITY
============

We adopt an ideology of practicality. Necessarily this might imply some trade-offs.

* We prefer "long-term" utility to "short-term" utility, but acknowledge that "short-term" practical concerns are often necessary steps to reaching

* Avoid "lock-in" where possible to remain flexible and nimble

UNIFICATION
===========

One of the main objectives of LangLang is to unify the many disparate technologies that are hindering progress of the world's IT infrastructure
and obstructing software development.

* A universal language
  Although LangLang is commonly refered to as a "Language-Language", it is also refered to as a "universal language".

  (Please note, we refer to LangLang as "A universal language" not "THE universal language". Although we do hope that LangLang will become a
  de facto standard 'universal' language we have no objective evidence that it is the best possible universal language - in fact it is almost
  by definition, impossible. Thus, the humble "A" is prefered. This notion is also reflected in our language versioning and extension policy.)


DIVERSITY vs HOMOGENEITY
========================

* One effect of unification is that homogeneity is desired, yet we find diversity is equaly desireable.
  Where possible we would like encourage both without compromise.

  (For example the language has one core calculus which allows all libraries to work together, however
  multipe syntaxes may be used )

THEORETICAL FORMALISM
=====================

* Take our tools from nature: I.e. mathematics logic etc.

HUMAN ASPECTS
=============

* Cast theoretical tools into a human-understandable forms
