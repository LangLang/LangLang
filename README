This package contains the LangLang specifications, policies and other documentation in
development. If you are looking for a LangLang compiler we recommend looking at "chomp"
which can be found at https://github.com/LangLang/chomp/.

It has not yet been decided exactly what licensing model should be used on documents.
However, the information is publicly viewable and most likely a permissive license in
the spirit of MIT/BSD will be used. It is also likely that this information will be
moved to a "wiki-like" service in the future.

Currently the following directory structure is being used:

  notes/         - Very rough brainstorming ideas and notes
  specification/ - More formal specification documents
  papers/        - Papers intended for peer-reviewed publication

All of the above are work-in-progress documents and should not be taken as "final".
Once an appropriate framework can be found or built all design documents will be placed
in a wikified framework that encourages colaboration and peer-review, history, release
tags, semantic meta-data etc.
